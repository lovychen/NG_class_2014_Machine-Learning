    # Instructions: Go over every example, find its closest centroid, and store
    #               the index inside idx at the appropriate location.
    #               Concretely, idx(i) should contain the index of the centroid
    #               closest to example i. Hence, it should be a value in the
    #               range 1..K
    #
    # Note: You can use a for-loop over the examples to compute this.
    #

            # OR
            # if distance < min_distance, reassign min_distance=distance and min_centroid to current j
